ALB vs NLB
ALB
  Layer 7 Application layer
  HTTP,HTTPS
  Flexible
  Rule, Host, Path Based routing
  Takes minutes to scale up
  No Static IP, Client needs to do DNS resolution
NLB
  Layer 4 Transport Layer
  TLS, TCP, UDP
  Static IP
  Better Latency Why??
  Takes sudden spike in traffic easily
  Comes with static IP, in case of Firewall setup, or client does not do DNS at all
CLB
  Layer 4/7
  Legacy, Avoid
