Terraform
  Plugins
    Provider
    Resource
    Output
      prints in console
    variable
      reference with var.varname
      if the value isnt defined t apply will take it in run time prompt
      terraform.tfvars file
        terraform looks for above file for variables
        to look for custom file
          t apply -var-file example.tfvars
      type constraint can be applied too
      same way you can create a list with comma seperated and to call it use a[0]
      can create objects with in the variables and to call it use a[0].name
